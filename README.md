## How do this project work?

This project/codebase is our main website. You can visit the production deployment here: https://www.flockcover.com

The architectural tech stack used is something called the JAMstack. JAMstack stand for client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. 

The JAMstack offers an alternative to the LAMP and MEAN stacks and has some advantages like scaling, security, speed, and developer experience.

The three main pieces of the stack we're using here is:

- Gatsby for static site as our static site generator. 
- Netlify for hosting and deployment (including staging).
- NetlifyCMS for our headless CMS.
