  faqs:
    - title: Are there any long-term commitments with Fly Unlimited?
      body: >-
        No there aren't. Fly Unlimited is a monthly contract, so there are no long-term commitments.


        You can pause, or cancel, your cover at anytime, and this will take effect on your next monthly renewal date. Don't worry, we'll never hit you with any cancellation fees.
    - title: Can I adjust my policy?
      body: >-
        Yes, you can adjust your policy at anytime during the month - with no admin fees! This can involve:


        * Adding (or removing) new drones and accessories

        * Adding (or removing) pilots

        * Changing your Public Liability limit


         Any changes that *increase* your coverage will take effect immediately, and we'll take payment for the price difference. Any changes that *lower* your coverage will take effect on your next monthly renewal date.
    - title: Can I get covered abroad?
