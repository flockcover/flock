        No there aren't. Fly Unlimited is a monthly contract, so there are no
        long-term commitments.


        You can pause, or cancel, your cover at anytime, and this will take
        effect on your next monthly renewal date. Don't worry, we'll never hit
        you with any cancellation fees.
      title: Are there any long-term commitments with Fly Unlimited?
    - body: >-
        Yes, you can adjust your policy at anytime during the month - with no
        admin fees! This can involve:


        * Adding (or removing) new drones and accessories

        * Adding (or removing) pilots

        * Changing your Public Liability limit


         Any changes that *increase* your coverage will take effect immediately, and we'll take payment for the price difference. Any changes that *lower* your coverage will take effect on your next monthly renewal date.
      title: Can I adjust my policy?
    - body: >-
        Yes, with Fly Unlimited you can easily extend your coverage worldwide as
        and when you need to. It's then easy to scale back your cover when you
        return.
      title: Can I get covered abroad?
    - body: >-

        compliant and EC785/2004 compliant.
