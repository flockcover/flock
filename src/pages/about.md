    For too long, insurance has been antiquated and inflexible. More often than
    not, you were tied into an annual policy that you had little control over.
    We wanted to change that, and believed that technology was the key.

    Through analysing real-time data we are able to form a precise understanding
    of the risk of an individual drone flight: How windy is it? Is the flight
    taking place during rush hour? Is it over a busy school? 


    These insights (and more) enable us to price insurance premiums on the spot;
    making drone insurance both smarter and fairer for all.

        Policies range from 1-8 hours, and can be purchased on the spot, or
        scheduled up to 10 days in advance.

        Pay for insurance only when you fly, with no up-front costs. Flock’s
        pricing is risk-dependent, so the safer the flight, the less you pay.

        Fly with peace of mind knowing that Flock’s policies are EC785/2004
        compliant and approved by the CAA.

        Since you can pinpoint the cost of insurance for each job, you can
        easily pass the costs onto your clients.
