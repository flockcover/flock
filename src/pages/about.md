    We're Flock, a high-energy, London-based startup rebuilding insurance from
    the ground up. 


    We believe that insurance doesn't have to be boring. It can be smart, and
    powered by real-time data. It can be fully digital. It can even help to make
    flying robots safer. 


    We have our roots in academia, arising from research papers at Imperial
    College London and Cambridge University. We launched Europe’s first
    'pay-as-you-fly' drone insurance product in 2018, and have skyrocketed since
    then. Our digital underwriting platform has unlocked a range of data-driven
    insurance and risk management products in the drone industry, from our
    [on-demand insurance
    app](https://blog.flockcover.com/how-to-insure-a-flying-robot-ca9744cc3e60/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=aboutus&utm_campaign=website)
    for micro-SMEs, to our [exposure-based enterprise
    product](https://landing.flockcover.com/enterprise-whitepaper/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=aboutus&utm_campaign=website)
    for the world’s largest drone fleets. We now help thousands of customers to
    fly

    and smarter every single day. 


    We’re now working with insurers to redefine the global insurance industry.
    The sky is by no means the limit at Flock; we’re on a mission to make the
    world a safer, smarter place, and we’re just getting started!

        Policies range from 1-8 hours, and can be purchased on the spot, or
        scheduled up to 10 days in advance.

        Pay for insurance only when you fly, with no up-front costs. Flock’s
        pricing is risk-dependent, so the safer the flight, the less you pay.

        Fly with peace of mind knowing that Flock’s policies are EC785/2004
        compliant and approved by the CAA.

        Since you can pinpoint the cost of insurance for each job, you can
        easily pass the costs onto your clients.
