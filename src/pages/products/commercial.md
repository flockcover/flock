    quote: >-
      “With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!”

    quote: >-
      I hate drones. But I have one. And I insure my property because I'm a
      responsible adult. Flock are the best drone insurers. I use Flock.
