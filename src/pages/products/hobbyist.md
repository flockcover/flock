    Hobbyist drone pilots are not required by law to fly with insurance.
    However, a flying metal robot with spinning propellers has the potential to
    cause some pretty hefty damage; and paying a little now may save you a lot
    in the long run.

    Flock’s public liability insurance provides cover for the worst case
    scenarios; such as your drone accidentally hitting someone, or damaging
    another’s property. It also provides legal compensation if a noise complaint
    or Invasion of Priavy claim is made against you.


    With the Flock Cover app, you can get insured on the spot for as little as
    £3. It’s as quick and easy as ordering an Uber, and gives you total peace of
    mind the second you take off.
