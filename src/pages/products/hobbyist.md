    Whilst it's not against the law in the UK to fly without insurance, a flying
    metal robot with spinning propellers has the potential to cause some serious
    damage. 


    Flock's Public Liability insurance starts from just £3, and gives you peace
    of mind the second you take off.

      “With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!”
