    Hobbyist drone pilots are not required by law to fly with insurance.
    However, a flying metal robot with spinning propellers has the potential to
    cause some pretty hefty damage. So paying a little now may save you a lot in
    the long run.


    Flock’s public liability insurance provides cover for the worst case
    scenarios; giving you peace of mind the second you take off.

      “With all the current drone laws in the UK, having Flock is an added peace
      of mind. Another bonus is that Flock will insure non professional drone
      pilots. This is a brilliant app!”
