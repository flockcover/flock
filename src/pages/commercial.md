coverNote:
  bodyText: >-
    On your renewal you need to declare that you have valid EC785/2004 compliant
    insurance in place. With our CAA accepted Flock Cover Note, you can make
    your declaration without having to purchase a commercial policy first.

    This means you can wait until you’ve received your PfCO from the CAA and
    have a commercial job lined up before you take out one of our commercial
    policies- a nice way to save a few pennies!
