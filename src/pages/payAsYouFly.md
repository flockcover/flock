    analyses real-time data from your Flight Area to generate a unique Risk
    Report for each flight in seconds. Here's what we look out for:

    quote: Fly Unlimited has proved invaluable in providing me with full cover in months where I’m doing a lot of aerial filming but still retaining that level of flexibility to pause the cover if I’m flying less or doing other types of filming.
  - author: 'Calum, Aerial Photographer'
    image: /images/uploads/testimonial/4.jpg
    quote: Easy to use and comprehensive insurance. Would highly recommend!
