  faqs:
    - title: How is the risk-dependent pricing calculated?
      body: >-
        The prices of our Pay-as-you-fly policies are calculated on a per-flight basis, and are proportional to how risky your flight is. This is calculated by analysing data such as:
          * **Pilot profile:** Number of hours you have flown, claims history.
          * **Drone details:** Its weight, top speed, maximum flight height etc.
          * **Environmental data:** Distance to ground hazards such as hospitals or schools.
          * **Real-time weather conditions:** Includes the real-time wind speed, and probability of rainfall in the area you’re flying in.
    - title: Is Pay-as-you-fly drone insurance EC785/2004 compliant?
      body: >-
        Yes, you can have peace of mind that our commercial and training Pay-as-you-fly policies are CAA approved and EC785/2004 compliant.
    - title: How do I get proof-of-insurance for my PfCO application?
      body: >-
        You can get your proof of EC785/2004 compliant insurance emailed instantly to you via the Flock Cover mobile app. Simply tap on the ‘Your details’ in the main menu, and you’ll see a button that says ‘Get an insurance Cover Note’.
