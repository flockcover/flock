        The prices of our Pay-as-you-fly policies are calculated on a per-flight
        basis, and are proportional to how risky your flight is. This is
        calculated by analysing data such as:
          * **Pilot profile:** Number of hours you have flown, claims history.
          * **Drone details:** Its weight, top speed, maximum flight height etc.
          * **Environmental data:** Distance to ground hazards such as hospitals or schools.
          * **Real-time weather conditions:** Includes the real-time wind speed, and probability of rainfall in the area you’re flying in.
      title: How is the risk-dependent pricing calculated?
